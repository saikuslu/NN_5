**Justification :**
In code 1 AND 2, Read glass.csv data set data set and X_train has all the data expect for type column data and y_train had only type column data X_train and y_train has been divided into 80:20 Declared naive bayen ML algo foe CODE1 and SVM method for CODE2, to fit and train dara After protection the data it is stored in y_pred and data is present in y_test

After running boththe code and as per comparing the accuracy between both the methods, we can say that Navie Bayen has performed better than the SVM method. JUSTIFICATION:: Navie Bayes algorithm is more accurate and efficeint on large data sets since the space complexity and time is less when compared to SVM method.
